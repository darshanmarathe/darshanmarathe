### mkDOM (Make DOM)

https://github.com/darshanmarathe/mkdom

Have you written code like this 

    myElem.innerHTML = `<div class='card'> ${title} </div>

 and **Source Code Analysis Tools** for e.g. checkmarks are reporting as possible **XSS** attack the tool is right but then how to fix it ? Here comes the mkDOM library with a fluent API to help you 

    const div = mkDOM('div' , {
    "class":  'card'
    }).content(title)
    myElem.appendChild(div.element)

But now your code is safe and SCAT tools are happy with it. :-)
